# python-interview-coding
This repository contains the solution of average coding problems asked in the SDE level 1 and 2.
All the solutions are in python.

Questions- 

q1. Given an array consisting many inner arrays, flatten the array into one: example: input:[[6,4,7,[9,5,4,[2,4,8]]],[2,2,7],[9,0,7,[9,3,1,8,5]]] 
output: [6,4,7,9,5,4,2,4,8,2,2,7,9,0,7,9,3,1,8,5]

q2. 21 sticks problem: first the opponent will pickup the stick- minimumsticks = 1, maximum = 4, then you will pickup the stick.
the one picking up the last stick will be loser
write a code that will ensure that you will never loose

q3. Check if the string contains balance parenthesis or not

q4. Given an array of distinct elements and a number x, find if there is a pair with product equal to x.
and print all the pairs

q5. Given a string ‘str’ of digits and an integer ‘n’,
build the lowest possible number by removing ‘n’ digits from the string and not changing the order of input digits.
str = "4325043" , n=3
output = "2043"

q6. write a function that returns the Run Length Encoded string for the input string.
For example, if the input string is “aaabbccddd”, then the function should return “3a2b2c3d”

q7. You are given an array of integers. Return an array of the same size where the element at each index 
is the product of all the elements in the original array except for the element at that index. 
For example, an input of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] should return [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. You cannot use division in this problem.

q8. Find if Given number is power of 2 or not. More specifically, find if given number can be expressed as 2^k where k >= 1.

q9. Maximize partitions such that no two substrings have any common character input = '“ababcbacadefegdehijhklij” output = 3

q10. Find Square Root of a whole number without using standard functions

q11. Given a string S consisting only of opening and closing parenthesis 'ie '(' and ')', 
find out the length of the longest valid(well-formed) parentheses substring.
NOTE: Length of the smallest valid substring ( ) is 2.

q12. Given a matrix where each row and each column is sorted, check whether the given number is present in the matrix.

q13. Remove all the vowels from a string using decorator 

q14. Reverse the bits of an 32 bit unsigned integer A

q15. Given a string, check if it is a palindrome by ignoring spaces. E.g. race car would be a palindrome.

q16. You have an array of n elements, and a sum. Check if any 2 elements in the array sum to the given sum.

q17. Given an array A[] of N numbers and another number x,
determine whether there exist three elements in A[] whose sum is exactly x.

q18. Given an array of strings, return the common prefixes, 
if not found return an empty array. Ex. ['abcd', 'abb', 'acd'] -> return 'a'

q19. write the code to find the second max element in the array

q20. Write a code to print the diamond shape.

q21. Write a code to print the right angle triangle of stars.
